## Why we’re here
This guided experience helps you discover your **true inherent abilities** (born-wired superpowers), distinguish **proficient abilities**, and recognize **weak areas** (subjects your brain–body wasn’t naturally wired for). This is not a wishlist. [src:dm_experience_doc#This is not a wishlist]

## Next steps
1) Lean into **inherent abilities** — they’re your human superpowers.

3) Treat **weak areas** as low-priority — explore if you’re curious, but don’t over-invest.
